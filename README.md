Description of the project
This is a command-line interface (CLI) project that emulates the basic functionalities of Airbnb, allowing users to manage properties, bookings, and user accounts. It provides a simplified version of the Airbnb experience for property owners and guests.

Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is a Python-based interactive shell that allows users to interact with the Airbnb clone system by entering commands. It parses user input, processes the commands, and provides feedback based on the actions performed.

How to Use
The Airbnb Clone Console supports various commands for managing properties, bookings, and user accounts. Here are some basic commands and their usage:

create user <username> <password>: Create a new user account.
login <username> <password>: Log in to an existing user account.
logout: Log out from the current user account.
create property <property_name> <property_description> <price_per_night>: Create a new property listing.
list properties: List all available properties.
book property <property_id> <check-in_date> <check-out_date>: Book a property for a specified date range.
my bookings: List all bookings for the current user.
For more detailed information and a list of available commands, you can use the help command within the console.
